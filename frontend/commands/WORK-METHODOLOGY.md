# MANDATORY WORK METHODOLOGY

## Every Time User Asks Something:

### Step 1: SUMMARIZE
- Repeat back what user asked for
- List all requirements
- Confirm understanding

### Step 2: GAME PLAN
- List exactly what you'll do
- Step by step plan
- Estimated number of changes

### Step 3: IMPLEMENT
- Make the changes
- Test each change
- Verify it works

### Step 4: VERIFY
- Test the complete flow
- Check for errors
- Confirm it matches what user asked

### Step 5: EXPLAIN
- What you changed
- Why you changed it
- How it works now
- What user should see/do next

## Example Format:

# ALWAYS TRACK WHAT USER HAS DONE

## CRITICAL RULE:

When user says "I have done X" or provides a screenshot showing they've done something:

1. **IMMEDIATELY** update `/Users/redabouziane/Documents/Code/marococo-nativeapp/.cursor/USER-ACTIONS-LOG.md`
2. **ALWAYS CHECK** this file BEFORE suggesting next steps
3. **NEVER** ask user to do something already in this log

## Format for USER-ACTIONS-LOG.md:

```markdown
# User Actions Log

## [Date] - [Action]
- **What**: Clear description of what user did
- **Context**: Why they did it
- **Evidence**: Screenshot/message reference
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

---
```

## Rules:
- Update this file with EVERY user action
- Check this file BEFORE every response
- Reference this file when planning next steps
- NEVER forget what user has already done

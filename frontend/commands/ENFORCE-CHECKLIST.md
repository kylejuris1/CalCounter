# ENFORCE MANDATORY CHECKLIST - ALWAYS

## CRITICAL RULE: BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION

**YOU MUST:**

1. **READ** `/Users/redabouziane/Documents/Code/marococo-nativeapp/.cursor/commands/MANDATORY-IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md`
2. **FOLLOW** every step in the checklist
3. **VERIFY** each checkbox before proceeding
4. **UPDATE** the checklist if you discover a new mistake pattern

## WHEN TO USE THE CHECKLIST:

**ALWAYS** - Before writing ANY code that:
- Calls an API or SDK method
- Implements OAuth or authentication
- Handles navigation or routing
- Processes URLs or tokens
- Makes network requests
- Uses third-party libraries

## IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE:

**IMMEDIATELY** update the checklist with:

1. **What mistake was made**
2. **Why it happened** (assumption, didn't check docs, etc.)
3. **How to prevent it** (new checklist item)
4. **Example of correct approach**

## THE ENFORCEMENT:

**Before responding to the user:**
- [ ] Have I checked the mandatory checklist?
- [ ] Have I verified all APIs exist?
- [ ] Have I looked at existing code?
- [ ] Have I mentally tested the flow?
- [ ] Am I 100% confident this will work?

**If ANY answer is NO → GO BACK AND FIX IT**

**READ IT. FOLLOW IT. UPDATE IT. ALWAYS.**
